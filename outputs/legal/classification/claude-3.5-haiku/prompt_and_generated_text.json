The sequence involves extensive editing of a document named \"_swift_code_ ORDER N4.docx\", which suggests an order form\n2. There are multiple interactions with Dealdesk Approval Needed emails, indicating a kickoff process\n3. The document appears to be an order form with details like location (Texas, USA) and dates (1st April 2025)\n4. The workflow involves reading, editing, and iterating on the order form document\n5. There are numerous email replies and interactions seeking approval, which is typical of a SOW (Statement of Work) kickoff and order form creation process\n\nThe repeated editing, reading, and email interactions around the order document strongly point to this being a SOW kickoff and order form creation workflow.",

There are multiple interactions with a document named \"_swift_code_ ORDER 14.docx\", indicating an order form or SOW (Statement of Work) is being created and edited\n2. The user is extensively editing the document, including copying and pasting values (e.g., copying an amount of INR 500,000,000)\n3. There are email interactions about \"Need help with SOW\", suggesting this is a SOW kickoff process\n4. The numerous editing actions on the order form document point to the creation and iteration of the order form\n5. The workflow involves multiple document reads, edits, and email communications, which are typical of a SOW kickoff and order form creation process",

        "generated_text": "After carefully analyzing the user interaction sequence, I classify this workflow as:\n\n\\answer{SOW kickoff and order form creation}\n\nRationale:\n1. Multiple emails related to \"Approval for Pilot SOW\" indicate a Statement of Work (SOW) kickoff process\n2. Several interactions with Docusign for creating and signing software order documents\n3. Editing and saving a software order document (Dudoo_Soroco - Software Order 1_v3.docx)\n4. Detailed process of preparing, adding recipients, and sending an envelope in Docusign\n5. The sequence shows activities around creating, reviewing, and executing an order form associated with a SOW\n\nThe workflow primarily focuses on initiating a SOW and creating an accompanying order form, which aligns most closely with the \"SOW kickoff and order form creation\" classification.",
