The interaction involves extensive work in Excel (reading, editing, copying cells in a workbook named \"MS flow test.xlsx\")\n2. There are multiple interactions with a SharePoint approvals workflow, including:\n   - Adding new items\n   - Selecting and editing approvers at different levels (level 1, level 2, level 3 approvers)\n   - Navigating through an approval grid\n   - Assigning approvers to different stages\n3. The interactions suggest a contract or document review process that requires multi-level approvals\n4. The extensive editing and saving of Excel files indicates preparation of contract or financial documents\n5. The workflow involves routing documents through different approval levels, which is characteristic of contract updates and finance approval processes\n\nThe key indicators point to a contract-related workflow that requires financial review and multi-stage approvals.",
